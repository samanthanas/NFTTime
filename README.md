## Overview

#### Why Trade NFTs? 
    
   - Large investment firms are moving money into crypto 
   - Governments (like City of Miami) are incorporating crypto into city infrastructure
   - Some renowned investment firms are beginning to buy NFTs (like Cryptopunks)
   - Contemporary art has outperformed S&P for years
   - Digital art is more liquid than physical art
    
#### Risks:
   - Industry is new and uncertain: "long term hold" investment strategy is higher risk than short term gains
   - Asset can be traded 24/7 - gap risk is intense ATM especially as space continues to develop "hype"
    
#### Purpose of this Model:
   - Capture prices for NFT "flipping" (swing trading)
   - Help NFT traders forecast what their NFT purchase might look like a week or two later to provide a baseline to assess the approximate risk in this highly volatile space

## Data

- Source: Opensea API
- EDA revealed high number of sales for high-volume assets and times of day where sales are high (importance of hourly data)
- Datasets created for the collections being analyzed - collections are high-volume, must have 3 months worth of sales data available
- NFTs are still so new that it is hard to collect data for years at a time but fortunately a month-worth of sales contains thousands of transactions
- Data will be modeled with the past and validated in the present
